    <p>
      Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
      Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard<br />
      dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of
      type and scrambled it to make a type <br />
      specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap
      into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially <br />
      unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset
      sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and <br />
      more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker
      including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
